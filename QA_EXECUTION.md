# QA Execution Documentation — NotesApp

## 1. Purpose
This document records the software-quality execution performed against **NotesApp** and defines the evidence required to reproduce or extend the validation.

## 2. Execution scope
- Repository structure and source inspection
- Build/dependency configuration review
- Test-suite and CI workflow review
- Functional scenario identification
- Negative/error-path review
- Security-sensitive configuration review
- Deployment/runtime configuration review where present

## 3. Test execution record
| Area | Execution | Expected result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Repository integrity | Source/configuration inspection | No unexplained broken references | GitHub source |
| Build | Available project build command/CI | Build succeeds | CI/build logs when configured |
| Automated tests | Existing tests/CI | Tests pass | CI/test logs when available |
| Negative paths | Invalid input/error handling review | Controlled error response | Source/tests |
| Security | Secret/configuration pattern review | No confirmed credential exposure | Source inspection |
| Deployment | Workflow/deployment configuration | Valid configuration or documented limitation | Workflow/source |

## 4. Defect handling
Only defects supported by source evidence, failing tests, or CI/runtime evidence are treated as confirmed defects. Missing functionality or an empty/incomplete repository is documented as a limitation rather than fabricated into a defect.

## 5. Result
**Status:** QA execution documented.  
**Next action:** Run/extend the repository's native test and build commands when an executable application/test suite is available.

## 6. Evidence and limitations
This document distinguishes static inspection from actual runtime execution. A test is marked executed only when a test runner, build, CI job, or reproducible runtime check provides evidence.
